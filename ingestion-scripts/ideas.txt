Ideas that have not been implemented yet go in this file. Remove them as you implement them. 
Could also assign an idea to yourself if you plan on working on it in near future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check that primarycache is not off on any dataset, in general.
Check that secondary cache is not off on any dataset when the pool has L2ARC.
Warn on sync=disabled on any dataset.
Warn on sync=standard or writeback cache off on zvols.
Warn on atime=on on datasets. (worth it?)
Implement functionality similar to volume-check to warn on non-redundant vdevs,
      dissimilar vdev layouts, unequal disk sizes and unequal models
Implement analytics/correlate FMA data with disk issues ( and other hardware issues )
Warn on excessive space usage of snapshots (threshold TBD)
Warn on checksum=off anywhere
Warn on compression=!off/zle if compressratio < 1.02
Warn on mountpoint of child datasets not matching mountpoint of parent
Warn on zfs_no_write_throttle=1 or non-zero zfs_write_limit_override
Warn on any pools not ONLINE
Warn on any runners that are in maintenance
Check for LINK UP FC events in messages that are not on boot - might indicate fabric issue
Check for disks where not all paths are ONLINE or STANDBY
Check scsi_vhci.conf to make sure it has nothing stupid in it.
Check if all non-syspool disks are under mpxio
Warn about non-standard entries in sd.conf
Warn if any default FMA modules are not active
Check for error counter outliers in HBA stats (sasinfo) - need to find good examples
Warn if excessive daisy-chaining is detected in sasinfo expander -t (Tier 3 might already be shady, but depends on other conditions)
Warn if any driver instances of the same name have non-matching amount of interrupts assigned to them
Warn if any drivers share interrupts
Warn if kmem_flags != 0 (performance impact)
Warn if /etc/system doesn't match ::system | mdb -k - means something was changed since last reboot
Warn if recent dumps (<1 month old) are present in /var/crash/myhost
use the go-live directory/files to determine which Collector, if any, was used to perform SAC. note: older systems won't have this, indicate oldest several collectors in this case.
cifs/nfs nbmand check (nexchecklet? multiple related bugs):
* for each of cifs filesystems,
   check to see if it's also an nfs filesystem
       - if it is, verify whether nbmand is enabled
add 'single disk failure' detection (NEX-3988, NEX-6064)
add per-mpt_sas disk-centric analysis eg: grep -A1 mpt_sas6 $path_messages | grep target
fma data fmdump size check before running
`messages` size check before running
check messages for mpt_sas errors for specific disks and see if they have been removed from pool (eg. faulted drives not physically pulled)
add quick arc demand metadata hitrate check
Trashiba drive check http://supportwiki.nexenta.com/wiki/HDD_brand_specific_info MK1001TRKB MK2001TRKB
historic view of hardware on disk and/or jbod?
check for completeness of RSF config (entries in hosts, if used are present, hb disks alive)
create a check for "WARNING: svc_cots_kdup no slots free"
COMPELLENT check /home/support/ingested/2016-11-03/collector-T256-F4211C6985-65G668BJG-HORFMS_znas2_2016-11-03.10-31-05MDT

Warn on drives that aren't under mpxio that should be. (to prevent mismatched id's)
Warn when DataOn plugin is installed - it causes latency spikes roughly every 10 minutes because it runs "zpool import -D" and "zpool import -Fn" for no good reason, and servermain.py has a memory leak in it.
